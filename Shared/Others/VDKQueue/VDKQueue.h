//
//	BASED ON UKKQUEUE:
//
//		This is an updated, modernized and streamlined version of the excellent UKKQueue class, which was authored by Uli Kusterer.
//		UKKQueue was written back in 2003 and there have been many, many improvements to Objective-C since then. VDKQueue uses the
//		core of Uli's original class, but makes it faster and more efficient. Method calls are reduced. Grand Central Dispatch is used in place
//		of Uli's "threadProxy" objects. The memory footprint is roughly halved, as I don't create the overhead that UKKQueue does.
//
//		VDKQueue is also simplified. The option to use it as a singleton is removed. You simply alloc/init an instance and add paths you want to
//		watch. Your objects can be alerted to changes either by notifications or by a delegate method (or both). See below.
//
//		It also fixes several bugs. For one, it won't crash if it can't create a file descriptor to a file you ask it to watch. (By default, an OS X process can only
//		have about 3,000 file descriptors open at once. If you hit that limit, UKKQueue will crash. VDKQueue will not.)
//

//
//	DEPENDENCIES:
//
//		VDKQueue requires OS 10.6+ because it relies on Grand Central Dispatch.
//

//
//	IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ATOMIC OPERATIONS
//
//		There are two ways of saving a file on OS X: Atomic and Non-Atomic. In a non-atomic operation, a file is saved by directly overwriting it with new data.
//		In an Atomic save, a temporary file is first written to a different location on disk. When that completes successfully, the original file is deleted and the
//		temporary one is renamed and moved into place where the original file existed.
//
//		This matters a great deal. If you tell VDKQueue to watch file X, then you save file X ATOMICALLY, you'll receive a notification about that event. HOWEVER, you will
//		NOT receive any additional notifications for file X from then on. This is because the atomic operation has essentially created a new file that replaced the one you
//		told VDKQueue to watch. (This is not an issue for non-atomic operations.)
//
//		To handle this, any time you receive a change notification from VDKQueue, you should call -removePath: followed by -addPath: on the file's path, even if the path
//		has not changed. This will ensure that if the event that triggered the notification was an atomic operation, VDKQueue will start watching the "new" file that took
//		the place of the old one.
//
//		Other frameworks out there try to work around this issue by immediately attempting to re-open the file descriptor to the path. This is not bulletproof and may fail;
//		it all depends on the timing of disk I/O. Bottom line: you could not rely on it and might miss future changes to the file path you're supposedly watching. That's why
//		VDKQueue does not take this approach, but favors the "manual" method of "stop-watching-then-rewatch".
